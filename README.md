The "Heart Failure Clinical Data" dataset available on Kaggle provides comprehensive
clinical information about patients diagnosed with heart failure. This dataset was originally
compiled by Andrew V. Dluhoslavskyi and encompasses a wide range of attributes related to the
health status, medical history, and lifestyle choices of individuals affected by heart failure. The
dataset aims to support the development of predictive models and the exploration of factors
contributing to heart failure.

Heart failure is a serious medical condition that occurs when the heart is unable to pump
blood efficiently, leading to a reduced supply of oxygen to the body's organs. It affects millions of
people worldwide and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Predicting heart failure
occurrence and understanding the associated risk factors are crucial for early detection and
intervention, improving patient outcomes, and managing healthcare resources effectively.

The dataset comprises a total of 299 instances, each represented by 13 features along
with the target variable indicating whether the patient experienced a heart failure event or not.
The features include demographic information, various clinical and laboratory test results, and
lifestyle-related factors such as smoking and anemia.

This case study is divided into 4 major components pertaining to the different data mining
techniques, (a) Data Preprocessing, (b) Data Discretization and Binning, (c) Classification, (d)
Prediction.
